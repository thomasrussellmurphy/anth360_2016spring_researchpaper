  abstract = {Background
Since the legalization of abortion services in the United States, provision of abortions has remained a controversial issue of high political interest. Routine abortion training is not offered at all obstetrics and gynecology (Ob-Gyn) training programs, despite a specific training requirement by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Previous studies that described Ob-Gyn programs with routine abortion training either examined associations by using national surveys of program directors or described the experience of a single program.

Objective
We set out to identify enablers of and barriers to Ob-Gyn abortion training in the context of a New York City political initiative, in order to better understand how to improve abortion training at other sites.

Methods
We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 22 stakeholders from 7 New York City public hospitals and focus group interviews with 62 current residents at 6 sites.

Results
Enablers of abortion training included program location, high-capacity services, faculty commitment to abortion training, external programmatic support, and resident interest. Barriers to abortion training included lack of leadership continuity, leadership conflict, lack of second-trimester abortion services, difficulty obtaining mifepristone, optional rather than routine training, and antiabortion values of hospital personnel.

Conclusions
Supportive leadership, faculty commitment, and external programmatic support appear to be key elements for establishing routine abortion training at Ob-Gyn residency training programs.},

Its effect on physician abortion training was less apparent., In an effort to increase patient access to abortions after Roe, provision shifted from hospitals to nonhospital clinics. However, these procedures and patients were taken out of the medical education realm, and physicians became vulnerable to intimidation. The consequent provider shortage created an unexpected barrier to abortion access., Medical Students for Choice was founded in 1993 to increase abortion-training opportunities for medical students and residents. Its mission ensures that motivated medical students will learn and a growing number of physicians will commit to comprehensive abortion provision.},

  abstract = {Objectives
Lack of providers is a barrier to accessing abortion in Canada. The factors influencing the number of abortion providers are poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the attitudes and intentions of medical students towards abortion training and provision to gain insight into the future supply of abortion providers.
Methods
We surveyed first, second, and third year medical students at an Ontario university to determine their intentions to train in and provide abortion services during different stages of training and in future practice. We assessed students’ attitudes and intentions towards training in and providing abortions, their perceptions of social support, their perceived ability to receive training in and to provide abortion services, and their attitudes towards the legality of abortion.
Results
Surveys were completed by 337 of 508 potential respondents (66.7\%). The responses indicated that the students in the survey held relatively positive attitudes towards the legality and availability of abortion in Canada. Respondents had significantly more positive attitudes towards first trimester medical abortions (and a greater intention to provide them) than towards second trimester surgical abortions. Thirty-five percent of students planned to enter a specialty in which they could perform abortions, but fewer than 30\% of these students planned to provide any type of abortion. Intentions to provide abortions were correlated with positive attitudes toward abortion in general and greater perceived social support for abortion provision.
Conclusion
A small proportion of students sampled intended both to enter a specialty in which abortion would be within the scope of practice and to provide abortion services. Lack of perceived social support for providing abortions and the perceived inability to obtain abortion training or to logistically provide abortions were identified as two potentially modifiable barriers to abortion provision. We propose increasing education on abortion provision and creating policies to promote medical abortion as a method of improving access to abortion across Canada.},

Abortion is one of the most contested, yet common surgical procedures in the United States and a required component of obstetrics and gynecology resident education. Approaches to abortion training are variable.
Study Design
We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 physicians who had graduated 5–10 years prior from four US residency programs with routine abortion training. Interviews focused on their experiences with abortion during training and in practice.
Results
Graduates' positive and negative experiences demonstrated that many valued teaching about the social issues surrounding abortion as well as training in surgical skills. Respondents found training rewarding when attending physicians openly discussed their personal commitment to abortion practice, respected differences of opinions about abortion and demonstrated high regard for abortion training. Some residents who opted out of surgical training for abortion valued partially participating in the rotation.
Conclusions
Many physicians-in-training consider didactics related to the social context of care and respect for moral boundaries important components of abortion training.},

  abstract = {Background
This study was conducted to describe the experiences of residents who opt out of some components of a dedicated abortion rotation.
Study Design
Eligible residents at programs receiving funding from the Kenneth J. Ryan Residency Training Program in Abortion and Family Planning were invited to complete a cross-sectional, online survey.
Results
The majority of residents who opted out of some portion of the family planning training reported that the rotation positively affected skills in pregnancy options counseling, cervical dilation, first-trimester ultrasound, techniques of first-trimester uterine evacuation and other skills. Twenty-one of the 65 (31\%) did an elective abortion, and 56 (84\%) completed aspirations for at least one non-elective indication including therapeutic abortion and miscarriage. While no resident desired additional elective abortion training, 11 (16\%) wanted additional uterine aspiration and 14 (21\%) wanted additional second-trimester uterine aspiration training for non-elective indications.
Conclusion
Providing access to an abortion rotation for residents who do not plan to do elective abortions gives them the opportunity to improve their skills in family planning, therapeutic abortion and miscarriage management.},

To assess the availability and characteristics of abortion training in US ob-gyn residency programs.
Methods
We surveyed fourth-year residents at US residency programs by email regarding availability and type of abortion training, procedural experience and self-assessed competence in abortion skills. We conducted multivariable, ordinal logistic regression with general estimating equations to determine individual-level and resident-reported, program-level correlates of quantity of uterine evacuation procedures done during residency.
Results
Three hundred sixty-two residents provided data, representing 161 of the 240 residency programs contacted. Access to training in elective abortion was available to most respondents: 54\% reported routine training—where abortion training was routinely scheduled; 30\% reported opt-in training—where training was available but not routinely integrated; and 16\% reported that elective abortion training was not available. Residents in programs with routine elective abortion training and those who intended to do abortions before residency did a greater number of first-trimester manual uterine aspiration and second-trimester dilation and evacuation procedures than those without routine training. Similarly, routine, integrated training, even for indications other than elective abortion, correlated with more clinical experience (all p\&lt;.01, odds ratio and confidence interval shown below).
Conclusion
There is a strong independent relationship between routine training and greater clinical experience with uterine aspiration procedures.},

  shorttitle = {Routine training is not enough},
  abstract = {Background
Abortion provision remains threatened by the paucity of physicians trained to provide them. Lack of training during residency has been cited by obstetrician and gynecologist (ob-gyn) physicians as a reason for not including abortion in their practice.
Study Design
We administered surveys on interest, competency and intention to provide abortions to two groups of ob-gyn residents: one experiencing a new comprehensive and structured family planning rotation, and another group at our affiliate hospital's residency program receiving “ad hoc” training during their routine gynecology rotations. Surveys were anonymous and blinded to investigator.
Results
The structured family planning rotation group compared to the ad hoc group reported significantly increased competency score using a Likert scale in manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) (4.5 vs. 1; p=.003) and had a higher proportion reporting intent to provide office MVA postresidency (100\% vs. 39\%; p=.01) and being trained to 22.5 weeks' vs. 12 weeks' gestation (p=.005). In bivariate analysis, competency in MVA was associated with higher intentions to provide MVA after residency (p=.007).
Conclusions
A structured rotation in family planning and abortion for obstetrics/gynecology residents results in increases in competency and intentions to provide abortion, and an association between the two. In-hospital structured training proved to be superior to ad hoc training in our affiliate institution in improving competency and intention to provide abortion after residency.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Clinical innovations have made it more feasible to incorporate early abortion into family medicine, yet the outcomes of early abortion procedures in this setting have not been well studied. We wished to assess the outcomes of first-trimester medication and aspiration abortion procedures by family physicians.

METHODS Prospective observational cohort study conducted from August 2001 to February 2005 of 2,550 women who sought pregnancy termination in 4 clinical practices of family medicine departments and 1 private office/training site.

RESULTS The rate of successful uncomplicated procedures for medication was 96.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 95.5\%–97.0\%) and for aspiration was 99.9\% (CI, 99.3\%–1). Adverse events and complications of medication abortions were failed procedure (ongoing pregnancy; n = 19, 1.45\%); incomplete abortion (n = 16, 1.22\%); hemorrhage (n = 9, 0.69\%); and patient request for aspiration (n = 1, 0.08\%). One (0.08\%) missed ectopic pregnancy was seen among patients receiving medication. Four types of adverse outcomes were encountered with aspiration: incomplete abortion requiring re-aspiration (n = 21, 1.83\%); hemorrhage during the procedure (n = 4, 0.35\%); missed ectopic pregnancy (n = 3, 0.26\%); and minor endometritis (n = 1, 0.09\%). Missed ectopic pregnancies were successfully treated in the inpatient setting without mortality (overall hospitalization rate of 0.16 of 100). All other complications were managed within outpatient family medicine sites. Rates of complication did not vary by experience of physician or by site of care (residency vs private practice).

CONCLUSIONS Complications of medication and aspiration procedures occurred at a low rate, and most were minor and managed without incident.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Obstetrics and gynecology residents who are trained in family planning and intend to provide abortions after residency often do not ultimately do so. The extent of the professional barriers physicians face trying to integrate abortion into their practice is unknown. METHODS: In 2006, in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 obstetrician-gynecologists who had graduated 5–10 years earlier from residency programs that included abortion training. Interviews about physicians’ experiences with abortion training and practice were coded and analyzed using a grounded theoretical approach. RESULTS: Eighteen physicians had wanted to offer elective abortions after residency, but only three were doing so at the time of the interview. The majority were unable to provide abortions because of formal and informal policies imposed by their private group practices, employers and hospitals, as well as the strain that doing so might put on relationships with superiors and coworkers. Restrictions on abortion provision sometimes were made explicit when new physicians interviewed for a job, but sometimes became apparent only after they had joined a practice or institution. Several physicians mentioned the threat of violence as an obstacle to providing abortions, but few considered this the greatest deterrent. CONCLUSIONS: The stigma and ideological contention surrounding abortion manifest themselves in professional environments as barriers to the integration of abortion into medical practice. New physicians often lack the professional support and autonomy necessary to offer abortion services.},

Nine percent of nonhospital abortion patients must travel more than 100 miles and 18 percent travel 50 to 100 miles for services.

Some women face other barriers: Only 43 percent of all abortion facilities offer services past 12 weeks, and 27-37 percent of non-hospital facilities say they do not treat patients who test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. Women who need special services such as an administration of Rh immunoglobulin, general anesthesia or HIV testing usually pay extra for these services. In addition, 85 percent of nonhospital facilities that serve 400 or more abortion patients a year reported some form of antiabortion harassment in 1988, most commonly picketing; there was virtually no change in this proportion between 1985 and 1988.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT

Following a long-term decline, abortion incidence stabilized between 2005 and 2008. Given the proliferation of state-level abortion restrictions, it is critical to assess abortion incidence and access to services since that time.

METHODS

In 2012–2013, all facilities known or expected to have provided abortion services in 2010 and 2011 were surveyed. Data on the number of abortions were combined with population data to estimate national and state-level abortion rates. Incidence of abortions was assessed by provider type and caseload. Information on state abortion regulations implemented between 2008 and 2011 was collected, and possible relationships with abortion rates and provider numbers were considered.

RESULTS

In 2011, an estimated 1.1 million abortions were performed in the United States; the abortion rate was 16.9 per 1,000 women aged 15–44, representing a drop of 13\% since 2008. The number of abortion providers declined 4\%; the number of clinics dropped 1\%. In 2011, 89\% of counties had no clinics, and 38\% of women of reproductive age lived in those counties. Early medication abortions accounted for a greater proportion of nonhospital abortions in 2011 (23\%) than in 2008 (17\%). Of the 106 new abortion restrictions implemented during the study period, few or none appeared to be related to state-level patterns in abortion rates or number of providers.

CONCLUSIONS

The national abortion rate has resumed its decline, and no evidence was found that the overall drop in abortion incidence was related to the decrease in providers or to restrictions implemented between 2008 and 2011.},

  abstract = {Context: Accurate information about abortion incidence and services is necessary to monitor levels of unwanted pregnancy and women's ability to access abortion services. Methods: All known abortion providers in the United States were contacted for information about abortion services in 2004 and 2005. This information, along with data from the U.S. Census Bureau, was used to examine national and state trends in numbers of abortions and abortion rates, proportions of counties and metropolitan areas without an abortion provider, and accessibility of abortion services. Results: An estimated 1.2 million abortions were performed in the United States in 2005, 8\% fewer than in 2000. The abortion rate in 2005 was 19.4 per 1,000 women aged 15-44; this rate represents a 9\% decline from 2000. There were 1,787 abortion providers in 2005, only 2\% fewer than in 2000. Some 87\% of U.S. counties, containing 35\% of women aged 15-44, did not have an abortion provider in 2005. Early medication abortion, offered by an estimated 57\% of known providers, accounted for 13\% of abortions (and for 22\% of abortions before nine weeks' gestation). The average amount paid for an abortion at 10 weeks was \textdollar{}413-after adjustment for inflation, \textdollar{}11 less than in 2001. Conclustion: The numbers of abortions and the abortion rate continued their long-term decline through 2005. Reasons for this trend are unknown but may include improved access to and use of contraceptives or decreased access to abortion services.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The incidence of abortion has declined nearly every year between 1990 and 2005, but this trend may be ending, or at least leveling off. Access to abortion services is a critical issue, particularly since the number of abortion providers has been falling for the last three decades. METHODS: In 2009 and 2010, all facilities known or expected to have provided abortion services in 2007 and 2008 were contacted, including hospitals, clinics and physicians’ offices. Data on the number of abortions performed were collected and combined with population data to estimate national and state-level abortion rates. Abortion incidence, provision of early medication abortion, gestational limits, charges and antiabortion harassment were assessed by provider type and abortion caseload. RESULTS: In 2008, an estimated 1.21 million abortions were performed in the United States. The abortion rate increased 1\% between 2005 and 2008, from 19.4 to 19.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44; the total number of abortion providers was virtually unchanged. Small changes in national abortion incidence and number of providers masked substantial changes in some states. Accessibility of services changed little: In both years, 35\% of women of reproductive age lived in the 87\% of counties that lacked a provider. Fifty-seven percent of nonhospital providers experienced antiabortion harassment in 2008; levels of harassment were particularly high in the Midwest (85\%) and the South (75\%). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term decline in abortion incidence has stalled. Higher levels of harassment in some regions suggest the need to enact and enforce laws that prohibit the more intrusive forms of harassment.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Nearly halfof unintended pregnancies and more than one-fifth ofall pregnancies in the United States end in abortion. No nationally representative statistics on abortion incidence or on the universe of abortion providers have been available since 1996. METHODS: In 2001-2002, The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) conducted its 13th survey ofall known U.S. abortion providers, collecting information for 1999,2000 and the first half of 2001. Trends were calculated by comparing the survey results with data from previous AGI surveys. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2000, the number of abortions fell by 396 to 1.31 million, and the abortion rate declined 596 to 21.3 per 1,000 women 15-44. (in comparison, the rate declined 12\% between 1992 and 1996.) The abortion ratio in 2000 was 24.5 per 100 pregnancies ending in abortion or live birth, 596 lower than in 1996. The number of abortion providers decreased by 1196 to 1,819(46\% were clinics, 33\% hospitals and 21\% physicians' offices); clinics provided 93\%of all abortions in 2000. In that year, 34\% of women aged 15-44 lived in the 87\% of counties with no provider, and 86 of the nation's 276 metropolitan areas had no provider. About 600 providers performed an estimated 37,000 early medical abortions during the first six months of2001; these procedures represented approximately 696 of all abortions during that period. Abortions performed by dilation and extraction were estimated to account for 17\% of all abortions in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: Abortion incidence and the number of abortion providers continued to decline during the late 1990s but ata slower rate than earlier in the decade. Medical abortion began to play a small but significant role in abortion provision.},

clinics. This qualitative study explores abortion clinic
patients' opinions about receiving abortions from general
women's health care providers. Methods: We conducted 20h-long, semi-structured interviews with diverse women who had abortions in the U.S. Heartland. Each described her usual health care provider and how she accessed abortion care. We used
qualitative analytic methods to organize and interpret the
data. Results: Despite having a general provider, most women sought clinic abortions. Some women offered reasons for
preferring specialty care and others for preferring abortion from their general provider. Most women assumed their general provider did not ''do abortion'' and many believed those
providers were opposed to abortion. Women who had delivered a baby were concerned with their image in their general
provider's eyes. Two women were denied care by their general providers. Conclusion: Women's preferences for abortion care centered on privacy, cost, empathy, ability to control their image, and desire for safe quality care. Two women who sought abortions through their general providers experienced negative repercussions. Practice implications: General providers should proactively make patients aware of their positions on abortion and if supportive indicate that they can provide that care

  abstract = {Since the late 1960s, abortion has become a contested domain in American culture, one in which control over the relationships between reproduction, nurturance, sex, and gender is the object of struggle. Life stories of grassroots pro-choice and pro-life women reveal their activism, in part, as a process of creating new collective narrative forms for interpreting female life-cycle transitions. This activity is marked by distinctive generational experiences of different cohorts of women, revealing how different historical conditions make certain reproductive decisions dissonant with the available cultural models for marking them both cognitively and socially. Activism gives shape and meaning to "life scripts" through which women both manage and attempt to change structural contradictions between motherhood and work, which shape the lives of most American women.

The second fraction, FB, was specific for phosphatidates, had a low Km, and was inhibited, non-competitively, by diacylglycerol. FA exhibited a sigmoid substrate-activity curve. The isolated FB aggregated to particles of about 10(6) in the absence of salts and could be dissociated by the addition of monovalent cations at ionic strength 0.4-0.6 to about 2-10(5) daltons and thereby doubled its activity. Dissociation was time- and temperature-dependent. F- was inhibitory. Divalent ions were not required for the activity of FA or FB and inhibited at concentrations exceeding 1 mM.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates how the politics of abortion have impacted its medical practice in the United States. While residency abortion training has increased nationally since its post-legalization low in the early 1990s, the number of abortion providers continues to decrease. Mainstream physicians rarely integrate abortion into their medical practices. Instead, the responsibility for providing abortion has been consolidated within marginalized abortion clinics beleaguered by anti-abortion harassment and legislation.
Forty in-depth interviews, most with physicians of obstetrics and gynecology throughout the United States, were conducted in order to understand why physicians typically cease to provide abortion after residency. While abortion stigma and contention provide some obstacles, the dissertation shows that willing physicians are further encumbered by changes in the profession of medicine and organization of health care since the 1980s which have shifted the locus of power away from individual physicians and into the hands of their managers, employers, and insurers who may have different preferences around abortion practice.
Data from physician interviews are used to show how barriers such as workplace prohibitions, harassment, and fear of community boycott mediate doctors' sense of professional obligation toward abortion care. These concerns are often bigger deterrents than fear of violence from anti-abortion activists. This study presents a challenge to the commonly held assumptions that physicians decide whether or not to provide abortion based upon personal ideology. Rather, the failure to provide abortion among willing physicians is often structural rather than individual.
Institutional blockades, routine outsourcing, and professional intimidation hinder the integration of abortion services. The growing presence of Catholic-owned health care networks--that under the legal protection of conscience clauses prohibit employees to deliver abortion and contraceptive services--further complicates and constrains physician practices, even in certain cases of miscarriage management. For the most part, only physicians who work in insulated environments such as academic medical settings manage to perform abortions without "subspecializing" (doing almost exclusively abortions). Given the high demand for abortion, the structural barriers to its mainstream practice effectively constitute widespread institutionalized buck-passing, funneling abortion patients to freestanding clinics. Policy implications and suggestions are discussed in the conclusion.},
