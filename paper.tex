% Original general thesis: "Abortion training is becoming more available and being completed by more physicians, but this trend needs to continue so that future practicing physicians can provide better access to care, particularly with regard to primary care."
% Revised thesis points:
%   - training is not the only barrier
%   - policy influence on care provided due to individual and organizational beliefs
